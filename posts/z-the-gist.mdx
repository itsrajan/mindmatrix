## So, What is Minds On?

Hello wandering traveler! Welcome to the first ever Mind Matrix blog, where we will effectively discuss some essential points you may be wondering about us, such as:
- What is Minds On
- What is Mind Matrix
- What does Minds On do
- What can I do?

	Here’s the gist: in our polarized world, stress is omnipresent—and yet finding solutions is more difficult than ever. Minds On is a group of Peel teens that aim to redefine the help you get for mental health by building a place to grow. It is our duty as global citizens to give back to the community. We are tackling mental health head-first through a dynamic approach of community engagement and centralization, through events and engaging activities, and blogs, such as this one!<br/><br/>

	The plan for Mind Matrix is to educate, learn, and dismantle the stigmas surrounding mental health, not by acting as a faceless entity but showing our human side through articles such as this one. We are not only a club but a group of teens eager to learn and spread their findings regarding mental health, and we couldn’t be more glad to see you on our ride! <br/><br/>

	We’re not all words and no action, though. We have many exciting events and collaborations on the way that we can’t wait for you to see! As a quick sneak peek, here some of them:
- Brain Freeze Podcast; Our podcast which involves our charismatic members who will discuss all things mental health 
- Mental Health Summit; Our conference coming up in the spring where you can engage in thought-provoking discussions, learn more about mental health, and access our many booths of resources
- AMAs; Our Ask Me Anything webinars will include conversations with world-renowned leaders in the mental health field 
- Downtown Central; A mental health hub for resources, articles, and tangible solutions 
<br/><br/>
