Stress is omnipresentâ€”and yet finding solutions is more difficult than ever. We are a group of teens that aim to redefine the help you get for mental health through community engagement and centralization.

It is our duty as global citizens to give back to society; we need to redesign the way we think about our future.

Within the Peel Region, we are writing articles to raise awareness, redefining the architecture of mental health help, giving a voice to students and partnering with youth organizations.

A community is defined by the people within it. Minds On is building a world of elegance through mental health by constructing unique pathways for all.

We hope you can join us in this change.
