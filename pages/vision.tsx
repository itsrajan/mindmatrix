				In early 2020, billions around the world were in shock. No one could leave their homes and there was evident disregard for the mental health of communities. Funding & support for mental health is practically inexistent; this is when a few students came together and co-founded Minds On. <br/><br/>
        We are on a mission to develop our community and redesign the infrastructure of mental health support. We have a lot of upcoming initiatives that are in the works, so we kindly ask you to keep your eyes out for upcoming news!<br/><br/>
        Without our minds, who are we?
