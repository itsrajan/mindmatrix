				Stress is omnipresentâ€”and yet finding solutions
				is more difficult than ever. We are a group of teens that aim to redefine the help you get for mental health through <u>community engagement</u> and <u>centralization</u>.
			</h3><br />
			<h3>
				It is our duty as global citizens to give back to society; we need to redesign the way we think about our future.
			</h3><br />
			<h3>
				Within the Peel Region, we are <u>writing articles</u> to raise awareness, <u>redefining the architecture</u> of mental health help, giving a <u>voice to students</u> and partnering with <u>youth organizations</u>.  <br /><br />

				A community is defined by the people within it. Minds On is building a world of elegance through mental health by constructing unique pathways for all. <br /><br />

				We hope you can join us in this change, <br />
				<i>The Minds On Team</i>
